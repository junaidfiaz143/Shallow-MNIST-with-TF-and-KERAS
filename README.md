In this project you will discover how to effectively pure Tensorflow to predict the numbers in MNIST dataset as well as in high-level ML api Keras.

## Getting Started

### Description of the Dataset
Dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images.

You can learn more about this dataset on the Keras website:
https://keras.io/datasets/

### What we achieved doing this Project:
In this post, you discovered the MultiClass classification using TF as well as in Keras Deep Learning library in Python.

You learned how you can work through a binary classification problem step-by-step with Keras, specifically:

+	How to load and prepare data for use in TF/Keras.
+	How to create a neural network model.
+	How data preparation schemes can lift the performance of your models.
+	How experiments adjusting the network topology can lift model performance.
